# BITWISE OPERATORS #
1. perform operations on binary form of number

1. Bitwise & (AND)
    0 & 0 = 0
    0 & 1 = 0
    1 & 0 = 0
    1 & 1 = 1
2. Bitwise | (OR)
    0 | 0 = 0
    0 | 1 = 1
    1 | 0 = 1
    1 | 1 = 1
3. Bitwise ^ (XOR) - Exclusive OR  
    0 ^ 0 = 0
    0 ^ 1 = 1
    1 ^ 0 = 1
    1 ^ 1 = 0
4. Bitwise << (LEFT SHIFT OPERATOR)
    a << b => a*pow(2,b)
5. Bitwise >> (RIGHT SHIFT OPERATOR)
    a >> b => a/pow(2,b)
